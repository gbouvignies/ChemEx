## This is a sample configuration file for the module 'relaxation_hznz'

[experiment]

## Name of the chemex module corresponding to the experiment
name = "relaxation_hznz"

## State of the observed resonance [optional, default: "a"]
# observed_state = "a"

[conditions]

## 1H Larmor frequency, in MHz
h_larmor_frq = 800.0

## Sample temperature, in Celsius [optional, depending on the kinetic model]

[data]

## Directory containing the profiles [optional, default: "./"]
# path = "./"

## Option defining how intensity uncertainties are estimated.
## "file": uncertainties are taken from the profile files
## "duplicates": uncertainties are calculated from the duplicate points
## [optional, default: "file"]
# error = "file"

## List of the profile names and their associated filenames.
## The name of the spin systems should follow the Sparky-NMR
## conventions.
