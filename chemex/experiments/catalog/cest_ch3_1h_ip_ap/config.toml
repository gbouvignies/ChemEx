## This is a sample configuration file for the module 'cest_ch3_1h_ip_ap'

[experiment]

## Name of the chemex module corresponding to the experiment
name = "cest_ch3_1h_ip_ap"

## Recycle delay, in seconds
d1 = 1.0

## CEST relaxation delay, in seconds
time_t1 = 0.5

## Position of the carrier during the CEST period, in ppm
carrier = 0.5

## B1 radio-frequency field strength, in Hz
b1_frq = 25.0

## B1 inhomogeneity expressed as a fraction of 'b1_frq'. If set to "inf",
## a faster calculation takes place assuming full dephasing of the
## magnetization components orthogonal to the effective field.
## [optional, default: 0.1]
# b1_inh_scale = 0.1

## Number of points used to simulate B1 inhomogeneity, the larger
## the longer the calculation. [optional, default: 11]
# b1_inh_res = 11

## State of the observed resonance [optional, default: "a"]
# observed_state = "a"

[conditions]

## 1H Larmor frequency, in MHz
h_larmor_frq = 800.0

## Sample temperature, in Celsius [optional, depending on the kinetic model]
# temperature = 25.0

## Protein concentration, in M [optional, depending on the kinetic model]
# p_total = 500.0e-6

## Ligand concentration, in M [optional, depending on the kinetic model]
# l_total = 50.0e-6

## Labeling scheme of the sample, for deuterated samples "2H" should
## be used to obtain accurate initial estimates of relaxation rates
## based on model-free parameters [optional, default: []]
# label = ["2H"]

[data]

## Directory containing the profiles [optional, default: "./"]
# path = "./"

## Option defining how intensity uncertainties are estimated.
## "file": uncertainties are taken from the profile files
## "scatter": uncertainties are calculated from the baseline
## [optional, default: "file"]
# error = "file"

## List of offsets relative to the main resonance position
## (nu) and bandwidths (delta_nu) defining regions where
## points are excluded from the calculation (nu +/- 0.5 * delta_nu),
## both are in Hz [optional, default: [[0.0, 0.0]] ]
# filter_offsets = [
#   [0.0, 0.0],
# ]

## List of plane indices to be excluded from the calculation.
## The first plane has index 0 and is usually the reference plane,
## this plane is always excluded by default [optional, default: [] ]
# filter_planes = []

  ## List of the profile names and their associated filenames.
  ## The name of the spin systems should follow the Sparky-NMR
  ## conventions.
