# Pure in-phase ¹⁵N CPMG with [0013] phase cycle

## Module name

`"cpmg_15n_ip_0013"`

## Description

Analyzes ¹⁵N chemical exchange in the presence of high power ¹H CW decoupling
during the CPMG block. This keeps the spin system purely in-phase throughout,
and is calculated using the (3n)×(3n), single-spin matrix, where n is the number
of states:

    { Ix(a), Iy(a), Iz(a),
      Ix(b), Iy(b), Iz(b), ... }

This version is modified such that CPMG pulses are applied with [0013] phase
cycle as shown in Daiwen's paper. The CW decoupling on ¹H is assumed to be
strong enough (> 15 kHz) such that perfect ¹H decoupling can be achieved.
