# Methyl ¹³C CPMG (“H-to-C”)

## Module name

`"cpmg_ch3_13c_h2c"`

## Description

Measures methyl carbon chemical exchange recorded on site-specifically
13CH3-labeled proteins in a highly deuterated background. Magnetization is
initially anti-phase and is read out as in-phase. Because of the P-element only
even ncyc should be recorded. Resulting magnetization intensity after the CPMG
block is calculated using the (6n)×(6n), two-spin matrix, where n is the number
of states:

    { Ix(a), Iy(a), Iz(a), IxSz(a), IySz(a), IzSz(a),
      Ix(b), Iy(b), Iz(b), IxSz(b), IySz(b), IzSz(b), ... }
